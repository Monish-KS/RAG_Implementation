The foods we eat contain nutrients. Nutrients are substances  required by the body to perform its basic functions. Nutrients must  be obtained from our diet, since the human body does not  synthesize or produce them. Nutrients have one or more of three  basic functions: they provide energy, contribute to body structure,  and/or regulate chemical processes in the body. These basic  functions allow us to detect and respond to environmental  surroundings, move, excrete wastes, respire (breathe), grow, and  reproduce. There are six classes of nutrients required for the body  to function and maintain overall health. These are carbohydrates,  lipids, proteins, water, vitamins, and minerals. Foods also contain  non-nutrients that may be harmful (such as natural toxins common  in plant foods and additives like some dyes and preservatives) or  beneficial (such as antioxidants). 4  |  Introduction',\n",

There are three classes of macronutrients:  carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. These can be metabolically  processed into cellular energy. The energy from macronutrients  comes from their chemical bonds. This chemical energy is  converted into cellular energy that is then utilized to perform work,  allowing our bodies to conduct their basic functions. A unit of  measurement of food energy is the calorie. On nutrition food labels  the amount given for “calories” is actually equivalent to each calorie  multiplied by one thousand. A kilocalorie (one thousand calories,  denoted with a small “c”) is synonymous with the “Calorie” (with a  capital “C”) on nutrition food labels. Water is also a macronutrient in  the sense that you require a large amount of it, but unlike the other  macronutrients, it does not yield calories.

Simple carbohydrates consist of one or two basic units. Examples  of simple sugars include sucrose, the type of sugar you would have  in a bowl on the breakfast table, and glucose, the type of sugar that  circulates in your blood.

Glucose is then transported to all our cells where it is  stored, used to make energy, or used to build macromolecules. Fiber  is also a complex carbohydrate, but it cannot be broken down by  digestive enzymes in the human intestine. As a result, it passes  through the digestive tract undigested unless the bacteria that  inhabit the colon or large intestine break it down. One gram of digestible carbohydrates yields four kilocalories of  energy for the cells in the body to perform work. In addition to  providing energy and serving as building blocks for bigger  macromolecules, carbohydrates are essential for proper functioning  of the nervous system, heart, and kidneys. As mentioned, glucose  can be stored in the body for future use. In humans, the storage  molecule of carbohydrates is called glycogen, and in plants, it is  known as starch.

The three  main  types  of  lipids  are  triglycerides  (triacylglycerols),  phospholipids, and sterols. The main job of lipids is to provide or  store energy. Lipids provide more energy per gram than  carbohydrates (nine kilocalories per gram of lipids versus four  kilocalories per gram of carbohydrates). In addition to energy  storage, lipids serve as a major component of cell membranes,  surround and protect organs (in fat-storing tissues), provide  insulation to aid in temperature regulation, and regulate many other  functions in the body. 6  |  Introduction',\n",

On average, an adult consumes just over two liters  of water per day from food and drink combined.

A greater discussion of this will follow in subsequent  chapters in this book, as there is an enormous amount of  information regarding this aspect of lifestyle. Dietary habits include  what a person eats, how much a person eats during a meal, how  frequently meals are consumed, and how often a person eats out. Other aspects of lifestyle include physical activity level, recreational  drug use, and sleeping patterns, all of which play a role in health and  impact nutrition.

A balanced diet results when you do not consume one nutrient  at the expense of another, but rather get appropriate amounts  of all nutrients. 3.

Achieving balance in your diet entails  not consuming one nutrient at the expense of another.

To carry out  this isolation, he burned some seaweed and in the process, observed  an intense violet vapor that crystallized when he exposed it to a cold  surface. He sent the violet crystals to an expert on gases, Joseph  Gay-Lussac, who identified the crystal as a new element. It was  named iodine, the Greek word for violet. The following scientific  record is some of what took place in order to conclude that iodine  is a nutrient. Observation. Eating seaweed is a cure for goiter, a gross  enlargement of the thyroid gland in the neck. Hypothesis.

Around the world, other cultures had  similar views of food and its relationship with health. A famous  quote by the Greek physician Hippocrates over two thousand years  ago, “Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food” bear much  relevance on our food choices and their connection to our health. Today, the scientific community echoes Hippocrates’ statement as  it recognizes some foods as functional foods. The Academy of  Nutrition and Dietetics defines functional foods as “whole foods  and fortified, enriched, or enhanced foods that have a potentially  beneficial effect on health when consumed as part of a varied diet  on a regular basis, at effective levels.” In the latter nineteenth century, a Russian doctor of immunology,  Elie Metchnikoff, was intrigued by the healthy life spans of people  who lived in the tribes of the northern Caucasus Mountains. What  contributed to their long lifespan and their resistance to life- threatening diseases?A possible factor lay wrapped up in a leather  satchel used to hold fermented milk. Observing the connection  between the beverage and longevity, Dr. Elie Metchnikoff began his  research on beneficial bacteria and the longevity of life that led to  his book, The Prolongation of Life.

When you feel hungry, your body sends a message to your  brain that it is time to eat. Sights and smells influence your body’s  preparedness for food. Smelling food sends a message to your brain. Your brain then tells the mouth to get ready, and you start to  salivate in preparation for a meal. Once you have eaten, your digestive system (Figure 2.4 “The  Human Digestive System”) starts the process that breaks down the  components of food into smaller components that can be absorbed  and taken into the body. To do this, the digestive system functions  on two levels, mechanically to move and mix ingested food and  chemically to break down large molecules. The smaller nutrient  molecules can then be absorbed and processed by cells throughout  the body for energy  or used as building blocks for new cells. The  digestive system is one of the eleven organ systems of the human  body, and it is composed of several hollow tube-shaped organs  including the mouth, pharynx, esophagus, stomach, small intestine,  large intestine (colon), rectum, and anus. It is lined with mucosal  tissue that secretes digestive juices (which aid in the breakdown of  food) and mucus (which facilitates the propulsion of food through  the tract).',\n",

The first step is ingestion, which is the  intake of food into the digestive tract. It may seem a simple process,  but ingestion involves smelling food, thinking about food, and the  involuntary release of saliva in the mouth to prepare for food entry. In the mouth, where the second step of digestion starts, the  mechanical and chemical breakdown of food begins. The chemical  breakdown of food involves enzymes, such as salivary amylase that  starts the breakdown of large starch molecules into smaller  components. Mechanical breakdown starts with mastication (chewing) in the  mouth. Teeth crush and grind large food particles, while saliva  provides lubrication and enables food movement downward. The  slippery mass of partially broken-down food is called a bolus, which  moves down the digestive tract as you swallow. Swallowing may  seem voluntary at first because it requires conscious effort to push  the food with the tongue back toward the throat, but after this,  swallowing proceeds involuntarily, meaning it cannot be stopped  72  |  The Digestive System',\n",

As you swallow, the bolus is pushed from the mouth  through the pharynx and into a muscular tube called the esophagus. As the bolus travels through the pharynx, a small flap called the  epiglottis closes to prevent choking by keeping food from going  into the trachea. Peristaltic contractions also known as peristalsis in  the esophagus propel the food bolus down to the stomach (Figure  3.6 “Peristalsis in the Esophagus”). At the junction between the  esophagus and stomach there is a sphincter muscle that remains  closed until the food bolus approaches. The pressure of the food  bolus stimulates the lower esophageal sphincter to relax and open  and food then moves from the esophagus into the stomach. The  mechanical breakdown of food is accentuated by the muscular  contractions of the stomach and small intestine that mash, mix,  slosh, and propel food down the alimentary canal.

Chyme is a semiliquid mass of partially digested food that  also contains gastric juices secreted by cells in the stomach. These  gastric juices contain hydrochloric acid and the enzyme pepsin, that  chemically start breakdown of the protein components of food. The length of time food spends in the stomach varies by the  macronutrient composition of the meal. A high-fat or high-protein  meal takes longer to break down than one rich in carbohydrates. It usually takes a few hours after a meal to empty the stomach  contents completely into the small intestine. The small intestine is divided into three structural parts: the  duodenum, the jejunum, and the ileum. Once the chyme enters the  duodenum (the first segment of the small intestine), the pancreas  and gallbladder are stimulated and release juices that aid in  digestion. The pancreas secretes up to 1.5 liters (.4 US gallons) of  pancreatic juice through a duct into the duodenum per day.

Just as too much glucose is bad for other organs,  such as the kidneys and pancreas, it also produces negative effects  upon the brain. Excessive glucose levels in the blood can cause a  loss of cognitive function, and chronically high blood-glucose levels  can damage brain cells. The brain’s cognitive functions include  language processing, learning, perceiving, and thinking. Recent  scientific studies demonstrate that having continuously high blood- glucose levels substantially elevates the risk for developing  Alzheimer’s disease, which is the greatest cause of age-related  cognitive decline. The good news is that much research is directed toward  determining the best diets and foods that slow cognitive decline and  maximize brain health. A study in the June 2010 issue of the Archives  of Neurology reports that people over age 65 who adhered to diets  that consisted of higher intakes of nuts, fish, poultry, tomatoes,  cruciferous vegetables, fruits, salad dressing, and dark green, and  leafy vegetables, as well as a lower intake of high-fat dairy products,  red meat, organ meat, and butter, had a much reduced risk for  Alzheimer’s disease.1  Other scientific studies provide supporting evidence that foods  rich in omega-3 fatty acids and/or antioxidants provide the brain  with protection against Alzheimer’s disease.

This is because  cells need to maintain oxidative metabolism for energy production  that continuously regenerates adenosine triphosphate (ATP). For  oxidative phosphorylation to occur, oxygen is used as a reactant and  carbon dioxide is released as a waste product. You may be surprised  to learn that although oxygen is a critical need for cells, it is actually  the accumulation of carbon dioxide that primarily drives your need  to breathe. Carbon dioxide is exhaled and oxygen is inhaled through  the respiratory system, which includes muscles to move air into  and out of the lungs, passageways through which air moves, and  microscopic gas exchange surfaces covered by capillaries. The  cardiovascular system transports gases from the lungs to tissues  throughout the body and vice versa. A variety of diseases can affect  the respiratory system, such as asthma, emphysema, chronic  obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD), and lung cancer. All of  these conditions affect the gas exchange process and result in  labored breathing and other difficulties. The major organs of the respiratory system function primarily  to provide oxygen to body tissues for cellular respiration, remove  the waste product carbon dioxide, and help to maintain acid-base  balance. Portions of the respiratory system are also used for non- vital functions, such as sensing odors, producing speech, and for  straining, such as during childbirth or coughing.',\n",

These cells are called “insulin-resistant.”Insulin is  released after a meal and instructs the liver and other tissues to take  up glucose and fatty acids that are circulating in the blood. When  cells are resistant to insulin they do not take up enough glucose and  fatty acids, so glucose and fatty acids remain at high concentrations  in the blood.

It consists of over six hundred skeletal muscles,  as well as the heart muscle, the smooth muscles that surround  your entire alimentary canal, and all your arterial blood vessels (see  Figure 2.24 “The Muscular System in the Human Body”). Muscle  contraction relies on energy delivery to the muscle. Each movement  uses up cellular energy, and without an adequate energy supply,  muscle function suffers. Muscle, like the liver, can store the energy  from glucose in the large polymeric molecule glycogen. But unlike  the liver, muscles use up all of their own stored energy and do not  export it to other organs in the body. Muscle is not as susceptible  to low levels of blood glucose as the brain because it will readily use  alternate fuels such as fatty acids and protein to produce cellular  energy.

About 10 percent of bone tissue is remodeled  each year in adults. Bones adapt their structure to the forces acting  upon them, even in adulthood.

The major physical factors  contributing to body weight are water weight, muscle tissue mass,  bone tissue mass, and fat tissue mass. Overweight refers to having  more weight than normal for a particular height and may be the  result of water weight, muscle weight, or fat mass. Obese refers  specifically to having excess body fat. In most cases people who are  overweight also have excessive body fat and therefore body weight  is an indicator of obesity in much of the population.

The perception of the “ideal” body  weight is additionally dependent on cultural factors and the  mainstream societal advertisement of beauty. To standardize the “ideal” body weight and relate it to health,  scientists have devised mathematical formulas to better define a  healthy weight.

BMI Limitations  A BMI is a fairly simple measurement and does not take into account  fat mass or fat distribution in the body, both of which are additional  predictors of disease risk. Body fat weighs less than muscle mass. Therefore, BMI can sometimes underestimate the amount of body  fat in overweight or obese people and overestimate it in more  muscular people. For instance, a muscular athlete will have more  muscle mass (which is heavier than fat mass) than a sedentary  individual of the same height. Based on their BMIs the muscular  athlete would be less “ideal” and may be categorized as more  overweight or obese than the sedentary individual; however this is  an infrequent problem with BMI calculation. Additionally, an older  person with osteoporosis (decreased bone mass) will have a lower  BMI than an older person of the same height without osteoporosis,  even though the person with osteoporosis may have more fat mass. BMI is a useful inexpensive tool to categorize people and is highly  correlative with disease risk, but other measurements are needed to  diagnose obesity and more accurately assess disease risk.',\n",

Having more fat mass may be indicative of disease  risk, but fat mass also varies with sex, age, and physical activity  level. Females have more fat mass, which is needed for reproduction  and, in part, is a consequence of different levels of hormones. The  optimal fat content of a female is between 20 and 30 percent of  her total weight and for a male is between 12 and 20 percent. Fat  mass can be measured in a variety of ways. The simplest and lowest- cost way is the skin-fold test. A health professional uses a caliper to  measure the thickness of skin on the back, arm, and other parts of  the body and compares it to standards to assess body fatness. It is  a noninvasive and fairly accurate method of measuring fat mass, but  similar to BMI, is compared to standards of mostly young to middle- aged adults.',\n",

Water is never transported actively; that is,  it never takes energy for water to move between compartments.

The  concentration is the amount of particles in a set volume of water.

The force driving the water movement through the selectively  permeable membrane is the higher solute concentration on the  one side.

The higher concentration of solutes on one side compared  to the other of the U-tube exerts osmotic pressure, pulling the  water to a higher volume on the side of the U-tube containing  more dissolved particles. When the osmotic pressure is equal to the  pressure of the water on the selectively permeable membrane, net  water movement stops (though it still diffuses back and forth at an  equal rate).

Additionally, hard labor  can produce substantial sodium loss through sweat. In either case,  the lost sodium is easily replaced in the next snack or meal. In athletes hyponatremia, or a low blood-sodium level, is not  so much the result of excessive sodium loss in sweat, but rather  drinking too much water. The excess water dilutes the sodium  concentration in blood. Illnesses causing vomiting, sweating, and  diarrhea may also cause hyponatremia.',\n",

As with sodium, potassium levels in the blood are strictly  regulated. The hormone aldosterone is what primarily controls  potassium levels, but other hormones (such as insulin) also play  a role. When potassium levels in the blood increase, the adrenal  glands release aldosterone. The aldosterone acts on the collecting  ducts of kidneys, where it stimulates an increase in the number  of sodium-potassium pumps. Sodium is then reabsorbed and more  potassium is excreted. Because potassium is required for  maintaining sodium levels, and hence fluid balance, about 200  milligrams of potassium are lost from the body every day.

Excessive water intake can dilute the levels of critical  electrolytes in the blood. Water intoxication is rare, however when  it does happen, it can be deadly. On the other hand, having too little  water in the body is common. In fact, diarrhea-induced dehydration  is the number-one cause of early-childhood death worldwide. In  this section we will discuss subtle changes in electrolytes that  compromise health on a chronic basis. High-Hydration Status: Water Intoxication/ Hyponatremia  Water intoxication mainly affects athletes who overhydrate. Water  intoxication is extremely rare, primarily because healthy kidneys  are capable of excreting up to one liter of excess water per hour. Overhydration was unfortunately demonstrated in 2007 by Jennifer  Strange, who drank six liters of water in three hours while  competing in a “Hold Your Wee for a Wii” radio contest.

Dehydration can be caused  by prolonged physical activity without adequate water intake, heat  exposure, excessive weight loss, vomiting, diarrhea, blood loss,  infectious diseases, malnutrition, electrolyte imbalances, and very  high glucose levels. Physiologically, dehydration decreases blood  volume. The water in cells moves into the blood to compensate  for the low blood-volume, and cells shrink. Signs and symptoms  of dehydration include thirst, dizziness, fainting, headaches, low  blood-pressure, fatigue, low to no urine output, and, in extreme  cases, loss of consciousness and death. Signs and symptoms are  usually noticeable after about 2 percent of total body water is lost. Chronic dehydration is linked to higher incidences of some  diseases. There is strong evidence that low-hydration status  increases the risk for kidney stones and exercise-induced asthma.

About  15 percent of Americans obtain drinking water from private wells,  which are not subject to EPA standards. Producing water safe for drinking involves some or all of the  following processes: screening out large objects, removing excess  calcium carbonate from hard water sources, flocculation, which  adds a precipitating agent to remove solid particles, clarification,  sedimentation, filtration, and disinfection. These processes aim to  remove unhealthy substances and produce high-quality, colorless,  odorless, good-tasting water. Most drinking water is disinfected by the process of chlorination,  which involves adding chlorine compounds to the water. Chlorination is cheap and effective at killing bacteria. However, it is  less effective at removing protozoa, such as Giardia lamblia. Chlorine-resistant protozoa and viruses are instead removed by  extensive filtration methods. In the decades immediately following  the implementation of water chlorination and disinfection methods  in this country, waterborne illnesses, such as cholera and typhoid  fever, essentially disappeared in the United States (Figure 3.12  “Deadly Water-borne Illnesses In United States”).',\n",

Health Benefits  The most renowned effects of caffeine on the body are increased  alertness and delay of fatigue and sleep. How does caffeine  stimulate the brain?Caffeine is chemically similar to a chemical in  our brains (adenosine). Caffeine interacts with adenosine’s specific  protein receptor. It blocks the actions of the adenosine, and affects  the levels of signaling molecules in the brain, leading to an increase  in energy metabolism. At the molecular level, caffeine stimulates the  brain, increasing alertness and causing a delay of fatigue and sleep. At high doses caffeine stimulates the motor cortex of the brain and  interferes with the sleep-wake cycle, causing side effects such as  shakiness, anxiety, and insomnia.',\n",

Although  the effect of caffeine on calcium excretion is small, postmenopausal  women with risk factors for osteoporosis may want to make sure  their dietary caffeine intake is low or moderate and not excessive. The Caffeine Myth  A diuretic refers to any substance that elevates the normal urine  output above that of drinking water. Caffeinated beverages are  commonly believed to be dehydrating due to their diuretic effect,  but results from scientific studies do not support that caffeinated  beverages increase urine output more so than water. This does not  mean that consuming caffeinated beverages does not affect urine  output, but rather that it does not increase urine output more than  water does. Thus, caffeinated beverages are considered a source of  hydration similar to water.

The primary source of water loss during intense physical activity  is sweat. Perspiration rates are variable and dependent on many  factors including body composition, humidity, temperature, and  type of exercise. The hydration goal for obtaining optimal  endurance and performance is to replace what is lost, not to over- hydrate.

However, consuming sports drinks  provides no benefit over water to endurance, performance, or  exercise recovery for those exercising less than an hour. In fact, as  with all other sugary drinks containing few to no nutrients, they are  only another source of calories. Drinking sports drinks when you  are doing no exercise at all is not recommended. Sports Drink Alternatives  Instead of a sports drink, you can replenish lost fluids and obtain  energy and electrolytes during exercise by drinking plain water and  eating a sports bar or snack that contains carbohydrates, protein,  and electrolytes. Post-exercise, low-fat milk has been scientifically  shown to be just as effective as a sports drink as a rehydration  beverage and it is more nutrient-dense, containing carbohydrates,  protein, and electrolytes, in addition to other vitamins. The Bottom Line  Sports drinks consumed in excess by athletes or used by non- athletes simply are another source of added sugars, and thus extra  calories, in the diet and provide no performance, exercise recovery  or health benefit. 224  |  Popular Beverage Choices',\n",

Saliva contains the enzyme, salivary amylase. This enzyme breaks  the bonds between the monomeric sugar units of disaccharides,  oligosaccharides, and starches. The salivary amylase breaks down  amylose and amylopectin into smaller chains of glucose, called  dextrins and maltose. The increased concentration of maltose in the  mouth that results from the mechanical and chemical breakdown  of starches in whole grains is what enhances their sweetness. Only  about five percent of starches are broken down in the mouth.

The type of carbohydrate within a food affects the GI along with  its fat and fiber content. Increased fat and fiber in foods increases  the time required for digestion and delays the rate of gastric  emptying into the small intestine which, ultimately reduces the GI. Processing and cooking also affects a food’s GI by increasing their  digestibility. Advancements in the technologies of food processing  and the high consumer demand for convenient, precooked foods in  the United States has created foods that are digested and absorbed  more rapidly, independent of the fiber content.

They are energy production, energy storage, building  macromolecules, sparing protein, and assisting in lipid metabolism. Energy Production  The primary role of carbohydrates is to supply energy to all cells  in the body. Many cells prefer glucose as a source of energy versus  other compounds like fatty acids. Some cells, such as red blood  cells, are only able to produce cellular energy from glucose. The  brain is also highly sensitive to low blood-glucose levels because  it uses only glucose to produce energy and function (unless under  extreme starvation conditions). About 70 percent of the glucose  entering the body from digestion is redistributed (by the liver) back  into the blood for use by other tissues. Cells that require energy  remove the glucose from the blood with a transport protein in their  membranes. The energy from glucose comes from the chemical  bonds between the carbon atoms. Sunlight energy was required to  produce these high-energy bonds in the process of photosynthesis.',\n",

Now that we know the benefits of eating the right  carbohydrate, we will examine exactly how much should be eaten to  promote health and prevent disease. How Many Carbohydrates Does a Person Need? The Food and Nutrition Board of IOM has set the Recommended  Dietary Allowance (RDA) of carbohydrates for children and adults  at 130 grams per day. This is the average minimum amount the  brain requires to function properly. The Acceptable Macronutrient  Distribution Range (AMDR) for carbohydrates is between 45 and  65 percent of your total caloric daily intake. This means that on  a 2,000 kilocalorie diet, a person should consume between 225  and 325 grams of carbohydrate each day. According to the IOM  not more than 25 percent of total calories consumed should come  from added sugars. The World Health Organization and the AHA  recommend much lower intakes of added sugars—10 percent or less  of total calories consumed. The IOM has also set Adequate Intakes  for dietary fiber, which are 38 and 25 grams for men and women,  respectively.',\n",

It’s the Whole Nutrient Package  In choosing dietary sources of carbohydrates the best ones are  those that are nutrient dense, meaning they contain more essential  nutrients per calorie of energy. In general, nutrient-dense  carbohydrates are minimally processed and include whole-grain  breads and cereals, low-fat dairy products, fruits, vegetables, and  beans. In contrast, empty-calorie carbohydrate foods are highly  processed and often contain added sugars and fats. Soft drinks,  cakes, cookies, and candy are examples of empty-calorie  carbohydrates.

The 2010 Dietary Guidelines recommends eating  more unrefined carbohydrates and more fiber, and reducing  consumption of foods that are high in added sugars. To accomplish  these recommendations use some or all of the following  suggestions:  • Get more daily carbohydrate servings from whole grains by  eating a whole-grain cereal for breakfast, using whole-grain  bread to make a sandwich for lunch, and eating a serving of  beans and/or nuts with dinner. • Make sure to get at least three servings (or more) of all the  grains you eat as whole grains every day. A serving of whole  grains is equal to one slice of whole-wheat bread, one ounce of  whole-grain cereal, and one-half cup of cooked cereal, brown  rice, or whole-wheat pasta. Food products made with cornmeal use the whole grain so  choose tortillas, corn cereals, and corn breads with cornmeal  listed as the first ingredient. • When baking, substitute whole-wheat flour or other whole- grain flour for some of the refined white flour. • If you like bread at dinner, choose a whole-grain muffin over a  Kaiser roll or baguette.

The differences in chemical structure between the  different carbohydrates confer their varied functional uses in foods. Starches, gums, and pectins are used as thickening agents in making  jam, cakes, cookies, noodles, canned products, imitation cheeses,  and a variety of other foods. Molecular gastronomists use slow- releasing carbohydrates, such as alginate, to give shape and texture  to their fascinating food creations. Adding fiber to foods increases  bulk.

This information fueled the still-ongoing debate of the  health consequences of all artificial sweeteners. In actuality, the  results from the early studies were completely irrelevant to humans. The large doses (2.5 percent of diet) of saccharine caused a pellet  to form in the rat’s bladder. That pellet chronically irritated the  bladder wall, eventually resulting in tumor development. Since this  study, scientific investigation in rats, monkeys, and humans have  not found any relationship between saccharine consumption and  bladder cancer. In 2000, saccharin was removed from the US  National Toxicology Program’s list of potential carcinogens.1  There have been health concerns over other artificial sweeteners,  most notably aspartame (sold under the trade names of NutraSweet  and Equal).

Most of the energy  required by the human body is provided by carbohydrates and  lipids. As discussed in the Carbohydrates chapter, glucose is stored  in the body as glycogen. While glycogen provides a ready source of  energy, lipids primarily function as an energy reserve. As you may  recall, glycogen is quite bulky with heavy water content, thus the  body cannot store too much for long. Alternatively, fats are packed  together tightly without water and store far greater amounts of  energy in a reduced space. A fat gram is densely concentrated with  energy—it contains more than double the amount of energy than a  gram of carbohydrate. Energy is needed to power the muscles for  all the physical work and play an average person or child engages in. For instance, the stored energy in muscles propels an athlete down  the track, spurs a dancer’s legs to showcase the latest fancy steps,  and keeps all the moving parts of the body functioning smoothly. Unlike other body cells that can store fat in limited supplies, fat  cells are specialized for fat storage and are able to expand almost  indefinitely in size.',\n",

Foods that are  high in fat contain more calories than foods high in protein or  carbohydrates. As a result, high-fat foods are a convenient source  of energy. For example, 1 gram of fat or oil provides 9 kilocalories  of energy, compared with 4 kilocalories found in 1 gram of  carbohydrate or protein. Depending on the level of physical activity  and on nutritional needs, fat requirements vary greatly from person  to person. When energy needs are high, the body welcomes the  high-caloric density of fats. For instance, infants and growing  children require proper amounts of fat to support normal growth  and development. If an infant or child is given a low-fat diet for  an extended period, growth and development will not progress  normally. Other individuals with high-energy needs are athletes,  people who have physically demanding jobs, and those recuperating  from illness.

If each available carbon bond holds  a hydrogen atom we call this a saturated fatty acid chain. All carbon  atoms in such a fatty acid chain are bonded with single bonds. Sometimes the chain has a place where hydrogen atoms are missing. This is referred to as the point of unsaturation.

Inside the intestinal cells, the  monoglycerides and fatty acids reassemble themselves into  triglycerides. Triglycerides, cholesterol, and phospholipids form  lipoproteins when joined with a protein carrier. Lipoproteins have  an inner core that is primarily made up of triglycerides and  cholesterol esters (a cholesterol ester is a cholesterol linked to a  fatty acid). The outer envelope is made of phospholipids  interspersed with proteins and cholesterol. Together they form a  chylomicron, which is a large lipoprotein that now enters the  lymphatic system and will soon be released into the bloodstream  via the jugular vein in the neck. Chylomicrons transport food fats  perfectly through the body’s water-based environment to specific  destinations such as the liver and other body tissues.

As we uncover what  hydrogenation is and why manufacturers use it, you will be better  equipped to adhere to healthier dietary choices and promote your  heart health. Hydrogenation: The Good Gone Bad? Food manufacturers are aware that fatty acids are susceptible to  attack by oxygen molecules because their points of unsaturation  render them vulnerable in this regard. When oxygen molecules  attack these points of unsaturation the modified fatty acid becomes  oxidized. The oxidation of fatty acids makes the oil rancid and gives  the food prepared with it an unappetizing taste. Because oils can  undergo oxidation when stored in open containers, they must be  stored in airtight containers and possibly be refrigerated to  minimize damage from oxidation. Hydrogenation poses a solution  that food manufacturers prefer.',\n",

Partially hydrogenated vegetable  oils are used in the fast food and processed food industries because  they impart the desired texture and crispness to baked and fried  foods. Partially hydrogenated vegetable oils are more resistant to  breakdown from extremely hot cooking temperatures.

Trans fats are used in many processed foods such as  cookies, cakes, chips, doughnuts, and snack foods to give them their  crispy texture and increased shelf life. However, because trans fats  can behave like saturated fats, the body processes them as if they  were saturated fats. Consuming large amounts of trans fats has been  associated with tissue inflammation throughout the body, insulin  resistance in some people, weight gain, and digestive troubles. In  addition, the hydrogenation process robs the person of the benefits  of consuming the original oil because hydrogenation destroys  omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids. The AHA states that, like  saturated fats, trans fats raise LDL “bad cholesterol,” but unlike  saturated fats, trans fats lower HDL “good cholesterol.”The AHA  advises limiting trans-fat consumption to less than 1 percent. How can you benefit from this information?When selecting your  foods, steer clear of anything that says “hydrogenated,” “fractionally  hydrogenated,” or “partially hydrogenated,” and read food labels in  the following categories carefully:  • cookies, crackers, cakes, muffins, pie crusts, pizza dough, and  breads  • stick margarines and vegetable shortening  • premixed cake mixes, pancake mixes, and drink mixes  • fried foods and hard taco shells  • snack foods (such as chips), candy, and frozen dinners  Choose brands that don’t use trans fats and that are low in saturated  fats. 342  |  Lipids and the Food Industry',\n",

In light of that, we present the following informational tips to help  you define, evaluate, and implement healthy dietary choices to last  a lifetime.

In excess, cholesterol  is harmful if it accumulates in the structures of the body’s vast  network of blood vessels. High blood LDL and low blood HDL are  major indicators of blood cholesterol risk.

The word protein is a Greek word,  meaning “of utmost importance.”Proteins are called the workhorses  of life as they provide the body with structure and perform a vast  array of functions. You can stand, walk, run, skate, swim, and more  because of your protein-rich muscles. Protein is necessary for  proper immune system function, digestion, and hair and nail  growth, and is involved in numerous other body functions. In fact,  it is estimated that more than one hundred thousand different  proteins exist within the human body. In this chapter you will learn  about the components of protein, the important roles that protein  serves within the body, how the body uses protein, the risks and  consequences associated with too much or too little protein, and  where to find healthy sources of it in your diet.

The first step in  constructing a protein is the transcription (copying) of the genetic  information in double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) into  the single-stranded, messenger macromolecule ribonucleic acid  (RNA). RNA is chemically similar to DNA, but has two differences;  one is that its backbone uses the sugar ribose and not deoxyribose;  and two, it contains the nucleotide base uracil, and not thymidine. The RNA that is transcribed from a given piece of DNA contains the  same information as that DNA, but it is now in a form that can be  read by the cellular protein manufacturer known as the ribosome. Next, the RNA instructs the cells to gather all the necessary amino  acids and add them to the growing protein chain in a very specific  order. This process is referred to as translation.

In contrast to carbohydrates, which  have identical repeating units, proteins are made up of amino acids  that are different from one another. Furthermore, a protein is  organized into four different structural levels. Primary: The first level is the one-dimensional sequence of amino  acids that are held together by peptide bonds. Carbohydrates and  lipids also are one-dimensional sequences of their respective  monomers, which may be branched, coiled, fibrous, or globular, but  their conformation is much more random and is not organized by  their sequence of monomers.

Quaternary:  The fourth level of structure is achieved when  protein fragments called peptides combine to make one larger  functional protein. The protein hemoglobin is an example of a  protein that has quaternary structure. It is composed of four  peptides that bond together to form a functional oxygen carrier. A protein’s structure also influences its nutritional quality. Large  fibrous protein structures are more difficult to digest than smaller  proteins and some, such as keratin, are indigestible. Because  digestion of some fibrous proteins is incomplete, not all of the  amino acids are absorbed and available for the body to utilize,  thereby decreasing their nutritional value.

Protein provides food with structure and texture  and enables water retention. For example, proteins foam when  agitated. (Picture whisking egg whites to make angel food cake. The  foam bubbles are what give the angel food cake its airy texture.) Yogurt is another good example of proteins providing texture.

Denaturation  refers to the physical changes that take place in a protein exposed  to abnormal conditions in the environment. Heat, acid, high salt  concentrations, alcohol, and mechanical agitation can cause  proteins to denature. When a protein denatures, its complicated  folded structure unravels, and it becomes just a long strand of  amino acids again. Weak chemical forces that hold tertiary and  secondary protein structures together are broken when a protein  is exposed to unnatural conditions. Because proteins’ function is  dependent on their shape, denatured proteins are no longer  functional. During cooking the applied heat causes proteins to  vibrate. This destroys the weak bonds holding proteins in their  complex shape (though this does not happen to the stronger  peptide bonds).

The teeth begin the  mechanical breakdown of the large egg pieces into smaller pieces  that can be swallowed. The salivary glands provide some saliva to  aid swallowing and the passage of the partially mashed egg through  the esophagus. The mashed egg pieces enter the stomach through  the esophageal sphincter. The stomach releases gastric juices  containing hydrochloric acid and the enzyme, pepsin, which initiate  the breakdown of the protein. The acidity of the stomach facilitates  the unfolding of the proteins that still retain part of their three- dimensional structure after cooking and helps break down the  protein aggregates formed during cooking. Pepsin, which is  secreted by the cells that line the stomach, dismantles the protein  chains into smaller and smaller fragments. Egg proteins are large  globular molecules and their chemical breakdown requires time  and mixing. The powerful mechanical stomach contractions churn  the partially digested protein into a more uniform mixture called  chyme.

Although severe protein deficiency is  a rare occurrence in children and adults in the United States, it  is estimated that more than half of the elderly in nursing homes  are protein-deficient. The Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution  Range (AMDR) for protein for adults is between 10 and 35 percent  of kilocalories, which is a fairly wide range. The percent of protein  in the diet that is associated with malnutrition and its health  consequences is less than 10 percent, but this is often accompanied  by deficiencies in calories and other micronutrients. In this section  we will discuss the health consequences of protein intake that is  either too low to support life’s processes or too high, thereby  increasing the risk of chronic disease. In the last section of this  chapter, we will discuss in more detail the personal choices you can  make to optimize your health by consuming the right amount of  high-quality protein.

Additionally, there is a scientific hypothesis that there may  be health consequences of remaining on high-protein diets for the  long-term, but clinical trials are ongoing or scheduled to examine  this hypothesis further. As the high-protein diet trend arose so  did the intensely debated issue of whether there are any health  consequences of eating too much protein.

The IOM used data from multiple studies that determined  nitrogen balance in people of different age groups to calculate the  RDA for protein. A person is said to be in nitrogen balance when the  nitrogen input equals the amount of nitrogen used and excreted. A  person is in negative nitrogen balance when the amount of excreted  nitrogen is greater than that consumed, meaning that the body is  breaking down more protein to meet its demands. This state of  imbalance can occur in people who have certain diseases, such  as cancer or muscular dystrophy. Someone who has a low-protein  diet may also be in negative nitrogen balance as they are taking in  less protein than what they actually need. Positive nitrogen balance  occurs when a person excretes less nitrogen than what is taken  in by the diet, such as during child growth or pregnancy. At these  times the body requires more protein to build new tissues, so more  of what gets consumed gets used up and less nitrogen is excreted. A  person healing from a severe wound may also be in positive nitrogen  balance because protein is being used up to repair tissues.',\n",

For thousands of years, alcohol has been consumed in a medicinal,  celebratory, and ritualistic manner. It is drunk in just about every  country and often in excessive amounts. Alcohol can be made from  a variety of different starch foods through the processes called  fermentation. Fermentation of a starchy food such as barley or  wheat can produce ethanol and CO2 which makes up what is  commonly known as beer. The Native Hawaiians distilled a mash of  fermented ti roots in iron try-pots pre-colonization in the 1700s. This form of alcohol was called “Okolehao”. This alcoholic beverage  more commonly known today as “moonshine”, is still made locally in  the islands today.1  Alcohol is a psychoactive drug. A psychoactive drug is any  substance that crosses the blood-brain barrier primarily affecting  the functioning of the brain, be it altering mood, thinking, memory,  motor control, or behavior. Alcohols in chemistry refer to a group  of similar organic compounds, but in beverages the only alcohol  consumed is ethanol.',\n",

However, alcohol displays its two-faced  character again in its effects on body weight, making many scientific  studies contradictory. Multiple studies show high intakes of hard  liquor are linked to weight gain, although this may be the result  of the regular consumption of hard liquor with sugary soft drinks,  juices, and other mixers. On the other hand drinking beer and, even  more so, red wine, is not consistently linked to weight gain and  in some studies actually decreases weight gain. The contradictory  results of scientific studies that have examined the association of  alcohol intake with body weight are partly due to the fact that  alcohol contributes calories to the diet. When alcohol is drunk in  excess, it reduces the secretion of pancreatic juice and damages the  lining of the gastrointestinal system, impairing nutrient digestion  and absorption. The impaired digestion and absorption of nutrients  in alcoholics contributes to their characteristic “skinniness” and  multiple associated micronutrient deficiencies. The most common  macronutrient deficiency among alcoholics is water, as it is  excreted  in  excess. Commonly  associated  micronutrient  deficiencies include thiamine, pyridoxine, folate, vitamin A,  magnesium, calcium, and zinc. Furthermore, alcoholics typically  replace calories from alcohol with those of nutritious foods,  sometimes getting 50 percent or more of their daily caloric intake  from alcoholic beverages.',\n",

The data is most convincing  for preventing heart disease in middle-aged and older people. A  review of twenty-nine studies concluded that moderate alcohol  intake reduces the risk of coronary heart disease by about 30  percent in comparison to those who do not consume alcohol.1  Several other studies demonstrate that moderate alcohol  consumption reduces the incidences of stroke and heart attack, and  also death caused by cardiovascular and heart disease. The drop in  risk for these adverse events ranges between percent. Moreover,  there is some scientific evidence that moderate alcohol intake  reduces the risk for metabolic syndrome, Type 2 diabetes, and  gallstones. In addition to providing some health benefits, moderate  alcohol intake also serves as a digestive aid, a source of comfort and  relaxation, and inducing social interactions, thereby benefiting all  aspects of the health triangle.

The chemical breakdown of those chemicals provides the  energy needed to carry out thousands of body functions that allow  the body to perform daily functions and tasks such as breathing,  walking up a flight of steps, and studying for a test. Energy is classified as either potential or kinetic. Potential energy  is stored energy, or energy waiting to happen. Kinetic energy is  energy in motion.

Proper nutrition provides  the necessary nutrients to make the energy that supports life’s  processes. Your body builds new macromolecules from the  nutrients in food.

The structural  elements of an atom are protons (positively charged), neutrons (no  charge), and electrons (negatively charged). Protons and neutrons  are contained in the dense nucleus of the atom; the nucleus thus has  a positive charge. Because opposites attract, electrons are attracted  to this nucleus and move around it in the electron cloud. Electrons contain energy, and this energy is stored within the  charge and movement of electrons and the bonds atoms make with  one another. However, this energy is not always stable, depending  on the number of electrons within an atom. Atoms are more stable  when their electrons orbit in pairs. An atom with an odd number  of electrons must have an unpaired electron. In most cases, these  unpaired electrons are used to create chemical bonds.

Metabolism is either categorized as catabolism, referring to all  metabolic processes involved in molecule breakdown, or anabolism,  which includes all metabolic processes involved in building bigger  molecules. Generally, catabolic processes release energy and  anabolic processes consume energy. The overall goals of  metabolism are energy transfer and matter transport. Energy is  transformed from food macronutrients into cellular energy, which  is used to perform cellular work. Metabolism transforms the matter  of macronutrients into substances a cell can use to grow and  reproduce and also into waste products. For example, enzymes are  proteins and their job is to catalyze chemical reactions. Catalyze  means to speed-up a chemical reaction and reduce the energy  required to complete the chemical reaction, without the catalyst  being used up in the reaction. Without enzymes, chemical reactions  would not happen at a fast enough rate and would use up too  much energy for life to exist. A metabolic pathway is a series of  enzyme catalyzed reactions that transform the starting material  (known as a substrate) into intermediates, that are the substrates  for subsequent enzymatic reactions in the pathway, until, finally,  an end product is synthesized by the last enzymatic reaction in  the pathway.',\n",

In response, the rate of catabolism  is slowed or shut off and the synthesis of fatty acids, which occurs  by an anabolic pathway called lipogenesis, is turned on.

A nutrient’s  metabolic path is dependent upon energy balance. When you are in  a positive energy balance the excess nutrient energy will be stored  or used to grow (e.g., during childhood, pregnancy, and wound  healing). When you are in negative energy balance you aren’t taking  in enough energy to meet your needs, so your body will need to use  its stores to provide energy. Energy balance is achieved when intake  of energy is equal to energy expended. Weight can be thought of as  a whole body estimate of energy balance; body weight is maintained  when the body is in energy balance, lost when it is in negative  energy balance, and gained when it is in positive energy balance. In general, weight is a good predictor of energy balance, but many  other factors play a role in energy intake and energy expenditure. Some of these factors are under your control and others are not.

Then we will consider the other  factors that play a role in maintaining energy balance and hence,  body weight. Estimating Energy Requirement  To maintain body weight you have to balance the calories obtained  from food and beverages with the calories expended every day. Here, we will discuss how to calculate your energy needs in  kilocalories per day so that you can determine whether your caloric  intake falls short, meets, or exceeds your energy needs. The  Institute of Medicine has devised a formula for calculating your  Estimated Energy Requirement (EER). It takes into account your  age, sex, weight, height, and physical activity level (PA). The EER is  a standardized mathematical prediction of a person’s daily energy  needs in kilocalories per day required to maintain weight. It is  calculated for those over 18 years of age via the following formulas:  Adult male: EER = 662 − [9.53 X age (y)] + PA X [15.91 X wt (kg) +  5.39.6 X ht (m)]  Adult female: EER = 354 − [6.91 x age (y)] + PA x [9.36 x wt (kg) +  726 x ht (m)]  Note: to convert pounds to kilograms, divide weight in pounds by  2.2. To convert feet to meters, divide height in feet by 3.3.

Muscle tissue burns more calories than fat tissue  even while at rest and thus the more muscle mass a person has, the  higher their BMR. Since females typically have less muscle mass and  a smaller frame size than men, their BMRs are generally lower than  men’s. As we get older muscle mass declines and thus so does BMR. Nutritional status also affects basal metabolism. Caloric restriction,  as occurs while dieting, for example, causes a decline in BMR.

Figure 8.7 Sagittal View of the Brain  This is a scan of a brain. The hypothalamus contains distinct centers  of neural circuits that regulate hunger and satiety. Hunger pangs are real and so is a “growling” stomach. When the  stomach is empty it contracts, producing the characteristic pang  and “growl.”The stomach’s mechanical movements relay neural  signals to the hypothalamus, which relays other neural signals to  parts of the brain. This results in the conscious feeling of the need  to eat. Alternatively, after you eat a meal the stomach stretches and  sends a neural signal to the brain stimulating the sensation of satiety  and relaying the message to stop eating. The stomach also sends out  certain hormones when it is full and others when it is empty. These  hormones communicate to the hypothalamus and other areas of the  brain either to stop eating or to find some food.',\n",

The discovery of leptin’s functions sparked a craze in the  research world and the diet pill industry, as it was hypothesized that  if you give leptin to a person who is overweight, they will decrease  their food intake. Alas, this is not the case. In several clinical trials  it was found that people who are overweight or obese are actually  resistant to the hormone, meaning their brain does not respond as  well to it.1  Therefore, when you administer leptin to an overweight or obese  person there is no sustained effect on food intake. Nutrients themselves also play a role in influencing food intake. The hypothalamus senses nutrient levels in the blood. When they  are low the hunger center is stimulated, and when they are high  the satiety center is stimulated. Furthermore, cravings for salty  and sweet foods have an underlying physiological basis.

You can begin this task by starting simple, such as  requesting extra tomatoes and lettuce on your burger and more  nutrient-dense choices in the salad bar. Also, choose their low- calorie menu options and help support the emerging market of  healthier choices in the fast food industry. In today’s fast-paced  society, it is difficult for most people to avoid fast food all the time.

A major problem with these theories is that they  overgeneralize and do not take into account that not all individuals  respond in the same way to changes in food intake or energy  expenditure. This brings up the importance of the interactions of  genes and the environment. Not all individuals who take a weight-loss drug lose weight and  not all people who smoke are thin. An explanation for these  discrepancies is that each individual’s genes respond differently  to a specific environment. Alternatively, environmental factors can  influence a person’s gene profile, which is exemplified by the effects  of the prenatal environment on body weight and fatness and disease  incidence later in life.1  One example is a study of the offspring of women who were  overweight during pregnancy had a greater propensity for being  overweight  and  for  developing  Type  2  diabetes. Thus,  undernutrition and overnutrition during pregnancy influence body  weight and disease risk for offspring later in life. They do so by  adapting energy metabolism to the early nutrient and hormonal  environment in the womb. 1. Matthews CE, Chen KY, et al. (',\n",

Doing one without the other  limits the amount of weight lost and the length of time that weight  loss is sustained.

The “Small-Change” Approach  Currently, most people are not obese in this country. The gradual  rise in overweight is happening because, on average, people  consume slightly more calories daily than they expend, resulting in  a gradual weight gain of one to two pounds a year. In 2003 the idea  was first published that promoting small lifestyle changes to reduce  weight gain occurring over time in all age groups may better reduce  obesity rates in the American population.10  Scientific studies have demonstrated that asking people to  increase the number of steps they take each day while providing  them with pedometers that count the steps they take each day  successfully prevented weight gain. A “small-changes” study  published in the October 2007 issue of Pediatrics evaluated whether  families that made two small lifestyle changes, which were to walk  an additional two thousand steps per day and to eliminate 100  kilocalories per day from their typical diet by replacing dietary sugar  with a noncaloric sweetener, would prevent weight gain in  10.

Retinol is the form of vitamin A found in animal-derived  foods, and is converted in the body to the biologically active forms  of vitamin A: retinal and retinoic acid (thus retinol is sometimes  referred to as “preformed vitamin A”). About 10 percent of plant- derived carotenoids, including beta-carotene, can be converted in  the body to retinoids and are another source of functional vitamin  A. Carotenoids are pigments synthesized by plants that give them  their yellow, orange, and red color. Over six hundred carotenoids  have been identified and, with just a few exceptions, all are found  in the plant kingdom. There are two classes of carotenoids—the  xanthophylls, which contain oxygen, and the carotenes, which do  not. In plants, carotenoids absorb light for use in photosynthesis and  act as antioxidants. Beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, and beta- cryptoxanthin are converted to some extent to retinol in the body. The other carotenoids, such as lycopene, are not. Many biological  actions of carotenoids are attributed to their antioxidant activity,  but they likely act by other mechanisms, too. Vitamin A is fat-soluble and is packaged into chylomicrons in  small intestine, and transported to the liver.',\n",

The retinoids are aptly named as their most notable function is  in the retina of the eye where they aid in vision, particularly in  seeing under low-light conditions. This is why night blindness is the  most definitive sign of vitamin A deficiency. Vitamin A has several  important functions in the body, including maintaining vision and a  healthy immune system. Many of vitamin A’s functions in the body  are similar to the functions of hormones (for example, vitamin A can  interact with DNA, causing a change in protein function). Vitamin A  assists in maintaining healthy skin and the linings and coverings of  tissues; it also regulates growth and development. As an antioxidant,  vitamin A protects cellular membranes, helps in maintaining  glutathione levels, and influences the amount and activity of  enzymes that detoxify free radicals. Vision  Retinol that is circulating in the blood is taken up by cells in the  eye retina, where it is converted to retinal and is used to help  the pigment rhodopsin, which is involved in the eye’s ability to see  under low light conditions. A deficiency in vitamin A thus results in  less rhodopsin and a decrease in the detection of low-level light, a  condition referred to as night-blindness.',\n",

In Asia in the late 1980s,  targeted populations of children were administered vitamin A  supplements, and the death rates from measles and diarrhea  declined by up to 50 percent. Vitamin A supplementation in these  deficient populations did not reduce the number of children who  contracted these diseases, but it did decrease the severity of the  diseases so that they were no longer fatal. Soon after the results  of these studies were communicated to the rest of the world, the  World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations  Children’s Fund (UNICEF) commenced worldwide campaigns  against vitamin A deficiency. UNICEF estimates that the distribution  of over half a billion vitamin A capsules prevents 350,000 childhood  deaths annually.1  In the twenty-first century, science has demonstrated that  vitamin A greatly affects the immune system. What we are still  lacking are clinical trials investigating the proper doses of vitamin  A required to help ward off infectious disease and how large of  an effect vitamin A supplementation has on populations that are  not deficient in this vitamin. This brings up one of our common  themes in this text—micronutrient deficiencies may contribute to  the development, progression, and severity of a disease, but this  does not mean that an increased intake of these micronutrients will  solely prevent or cure disease. The effect, as usual, is cumulative and  depends on the diet as a whole, among other things. 1. Sommer A. (2008).',\n",

This  is the primary way that vitamin A affects growth and development. Vitamin A deficiency in children is linked to growth retardation;  however, vitamin A deficiency is often accompanied by protein  malnutrition and iron deficiency, thereby confounding the  investigation of vitamin A’s specific effects on growth and  development.

Furthermore, both males and females require  vitamin A in the diet to effectively reproduce. Cancer  Vitamin A’s role in regulating cell growth and death, especially in  tissues that line and cover organs, suggests it may be effective in  treating certain cancers of the lung, neck, and liver. It has been  shown in some observational studies that vitamin A-deficient  populations have a higher risk for some cancers. However, vitamin  A supplements have actually been found to increase the risk of lung  cancer in people who are at high risk for the disease (i.e., smokers,  ex-smokers, workers exposed to asbestos).

There is  preformed vitamin A, which is abundant in many animal-derived  foods, and there are carotenoids, which are found in high  concentrations in vibrantly colored fruits and vegetables and some  oils. Some carotenoids are converted to retinol in the body by  intestinal cells and liver cells. However, only minuscule amounts  of certain carotenoids are converted to retinol, meaning fruits and  vegetables are not necessarily good sources of vitamin A.  The RDA for vitamin A includes all sources of vitamin A. The  RDA for vitamin A is given in mcg of Retinol Activity Equivalent  (RAE) to take into account the many different forms it is available  in. The human body converts all dietary sources of vitamin A into  retinol. Therefore, 1 mcg of retinol is equivalent to 12 mcg of beta- carotene, and 24 mcg of alpha-carotene or beta-cryptoxanthin. For  example, 12 micrograms of fruit- or vegetable-based beta-carotene  will yield 1 microgram of retinol. Currently vitamin A listed in food  and on supplement labels use international units (IUs). The following  conversions are listed below3:  • 1 IU retinol = 0.3 mcg RAE  • 1 IU beta-carotene from dietary supplements = 0.15 mcg RAE  • 1 IU beta-carotene from food = 0.05 mcg RAE  • 1 IU alpha-carotene or beta-cryptoxanthin = 0.025 mcg RAE  3.

Rickets  is very common among children in developing countries and is  characterized by soft, weak, deformed bones that are exceptionally  susceptible to fracture. In adults, vitamin D deficiency causes a  similar disease called osteomalacia, which is characterized by low  BMD. Osteomalacia has the same symptoms and consequences as  osteoporosis and often coexists with osteoporosis. Vitamin D  deficiency is common, especially in the elderly population, dark- skinned populations, and in the many people who live in the  northern latitudes where sunlight exposure is much decreased  during the long winter season.

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD)  primarily occurs in people over age fifty and is the progressive loss  of central vision resulting from damage to the center of the retina,  referred to as the macula. There are two forms of AMD, dry and wet,  with wet being the more severe form.

Vitamin K is critical for blood function acting  as coenzymes which play an essential role in blood coagulation (aka  blood clotting). Blood-clotting proteins are continuously circulating  in the blood. Upon injury to a blood vessel, platelets stick to the  wound forming a plug. Without vitamin K, blood would not clot. A deficiency in vitamin K causes bleeding disorders. It is relatively  rare, but people who have liver or pancreatic disease, celiac disease,  or malabsorption conditions are at higher risk for vitamin K  deficiency.

In fact, British sailors in the past were often referred  to as “limeys” as they carried sacks of limes onto ships to prevent  scurvy. Vitamin C is not found in significant amounts in animal- based foods. Because vitamin C is water-soluble, it leaches away from foods  considerably during cooking, freezing, thawing, and canning. Up to  50 percent of vitamin C can be boiled away. Therefore, to maximize  vitamin C intake from foods, you should eat fruits and vegetables  raw or lightly steamed.

It acts as  a cofactor for enzymes that break down glucose for energy  production (Figure 9.7 “Enzyme Active Site for Cofactors” ). Thiamin  plays a key role in nerve cells as the glucose that is catabolized by  thiamin is needed for an energy source. Additionally, thiamin plays a  role in the synthesis of neurotransmitters and is therefore required  for RNA, DNA, and ATP synthesis. The brain and heart are most affected by a deficiency in thiamin. Thiamin deficiency, also known as beriberi, can cause symptoms  of fatigue, confusion, movement impairment, pain in the lower  extremities, swelling, and heart failure. It is prevalent in societies  whose main dietary staple is white rice. During the processing of  white rice, the bran is removed, along with what were called in  the early nineteenth century, “accessory factors,” that are vital for  metabolism. Dutch physician Dr. Christiaan Eijkman cured chickens  of beriberi by feeding them unpolished rice bran in 1897. By 1912, Sir  Frederick Gowland Hopkins determined from his experiments with  animals that the “accessory factors,” eventually renamed vitamins,  are needed in the diet to support growth, since animals fed a diet  of pure carbohydrates, proteins, fats, and minerals failed to  grow.4Eijkman and Hopkins were awarded the Nobel Prize in  Physiology (or Medicine) in 1929 for their discoveries in the  emerging science of nutrition.',\n",

NADH is the predominant electron carrier and  transfers electrons to the electron-transport chain to make ATP. NADPH is also required for the anabolic pathways of fatty-acid  and cholesterol synthesis. In contrast to other vitamins, niacin can  be synthesized by humans from the amino acid tryptophan in an  anabolic process requiring enzymes dependent on riboflavin,  vitamin B6, and iron. Niacin is made from tryptophan only after  tryptophan has met all of its other needs in the body.

The “feeling” of more energy from energy-boosting supplements  stems from the high amount of added sugars, caffeine, and other  herbal stimulants that accompany the high doses of B vitamins.

Its  symptoms were severe and included diarrhea, dermatitis, dementia,  and even death. Some of the health consequences of pellagra are  the result of niacin being in insufficient supply to support the body’s  metabolic functions.',\n",

Based on the antioxidant-supplement  industry’s success, the general public appears to believe these  health claims. However, these claims are not backed by scientific  evidence; rather, there is some evidence suggesting supplements  can actually cause harm. While scientists have found evidence  supporting the consumption of antioxidant-rich foods as a method  of reducing the risk of chronic disease, there is no “miracle cure”;  no pill or supplement alone can provide the same benefits as a  healthy diet. Remember, it is the combination of antioxidants and  other nutrients in healthy foods that is beneficial. In this section, we  will review how particular antioxidants function in the body, learn  how they work together to protect the body against free radicals,  and explore the best nutrient-rich dietary sources of antioxidants. One dietary source of antioxidants is vitamins. In our discussion of  antioxidant vitamins, we will focus on vitamins E, C, and A.  Figure 9.21 Antioxidants’ Role  Antioxidants  |  593',\n",

For  example, the immune system uses the cell-damaging properties of  free radicals to kill pathogens. First, immune cells engulf an invader  (such as a bacterium), then they expose it to free radicals such as  hydrogen peroxide, which destroys its membrane. The invader is  thus neutralized. Scientific studies also suggest hydrogen peroxide  acts as a signaling molecule that calls immune cells to injury sites,  meaning free radicals may aid with tissue repair when you get cut. Free radicals are necessary for many other bodily functions as  well. The thyroid gland synthesizes its own hydrogen peroxide,  which is required for the production of thyroid hormone. Reactive  oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species, which are free  radicals containing nitrogen, have been found to interact with  proteins in cells to produce signaling molecules. The free radical  nitric oxide has been found to help dilate blood vessels and act as a  chemical messenger in the brain. By acting as signaling molecules,  free radicals are involved in the control of their own synthesis,  stress responses, regulation of cell growth and death, and  metabolism.',\n",

Oxidative Stress  Oxidative stress refers to an imbalance in any cell, tissue, or organ  between the amount of free radicals and the capabilities of the  detoxifying and repair systems. Sustained oxidative damage results  only under conditions of oxidative stress—when the detoxifying and  repair systems are insufficient. Free radical-induced damage, when  left unrepaired, destroys lipids, proteins, RNA, and DNA, and can  contribute to disease. Oxidative stress has been implicated as a  contributing factor to cancer, atherosclerosis (hardening of  arteries), arthritis, diabetes, kidney disease, Alzheimer’s disease,  Parkinson’s disease, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, emphysema,  and cataracts. Aging is a process that is genetically determined but modulated  by factors in the environment. In the process of aging, tissue  function declines.

They are found not  only in fruits and vegetables, but also in grains, seeds, nuts, and  legumes. Many phytochemicals act as antioxidants, but they have several  other functions, such as mimicking hormones, altering absorption  of cholesterol, inhibiting inflammatory responses, and blocking the  actions of certain enzymes. Phytochemicals are present in small amounts in the food supply,  and although thousands have been and are currently being  scientifically studied, their health benefits remain largely unknown. Also largely unknown is their potential for toxicity, which could be  substantial if taken in large amounts in the form of supplements. Moreover, phytochemicals often act in conjunction with each other  and with micronutrients. Thus, supplementing with only a few may  impair the functions of other phytochemicals or micronutrients.

Plant-based foods  often contain factors, such as oxalate and phytate, that bind to  minerals and inhibit their absorption. In general, minerals are better  absorbed from animal-based foods.

Although only 1 percent of  the calcium in the human body is found in the blood and soft tissues,  it is here that it performs the most critical functions. Blood calcium  levels are rigorously controlled so that if blood levels drop the body  will rapidly respond by stimulating bone resorption, thereby  releasing stored calcium into the blood. Thus, bone tissue sacrifices  its stored calcium to maintain blood calcium levels. This is why bone  health is dependent on the intake of dietary calcium and also why  blood levels of calcium do not always correspond to dietary intake. Calcium plays a role in a number of different functions in the  body like bone and tooth formation. The most well-known calcium  function is to build and strengthen bones and teeth. Recall that  when bone tissue first forms during the modeling or remodeling  process, it is unhardened, protein-rich osteoid tissue. In the  osteoblast-directed process of bone mineralization, calcium  phosphates (salts) are deposited on the protein matrix. The calcium  salts typically make up about 65 percent of bone tissue.',\n",

Calcium is also essential in blood clotting by activating clotting  factors to fix damaged tissue. In addition to calcium’s four primary functions calcium has  several other minor functions that are also critical for maintaining  normal physiology. For example, without calcium, the hormone  insulin could not be released from cells in the pancreas and  glycogen could not be broken down in muscle cells and used to  provide energy for muscle contraction. Maintaining Calcium Levels  Because calcium performs such vital functions in the body, blood  calcium level is closely regulated by the hormones parathyroid  hormone (PTH), calcitriol, and calcitonin. When blood calcium levels  are low, PTH is secreted to increase blood calcium levels via three  different mechanisms. First, PTH stimulates the release of calcium  stored in the bone. Second, PTH acts on kidney cells to increase  calcium reabsorption and decrease its excretion in the urine. Third,  PTH stimulates enzymes in the kidney that activate vitamin D to  calcitriol. Calcitriol is the active hormone that acts on the intestinal  cells and increases dietary calcium absorption.',\n",

It is reported that chelated forms of  calcium supplements are easier to absorb as the chelation process  protects the calcium from oxalates and phytates that may bind with  the calcium in the intestines.

The greatest positive influence on calcium absorption comes  from having an adequate intake of vitamin D. People deficient in  vitamin D absorb less than 15 percent of calcium from the foods they  eat. The hormone estrogen is another factor that enhances calcium  bioavailability. Thus, as a woman ages and goes through menopause,  during which estrogen levels fall, the amount of calcium absorbed  decreases and the risk for bone disease increases. Some fibers, such  as inulin, found in jicama, onions, and garlic, also promote calcium  intestinal uptake. Chemicals that bind to calcium decrease its bioavailability. These  negative effectors of calcium absorption include the oxalates in  certain plants, the tannins in tea, phytates in nuts, seeds, and grains,  and some fibers. Oxalates are found in high concentrations in  spinach, parsley, cocoa, and beets. In general, the calcium  bioavailability is inversely correlated to the oxalate content in foods.',\n",

These phosphate groups are essential  as a structural component of cell membranes (as phospholipids),  DNA and RNA, energy production (ATP), and regulation of acid- base homeostasis. Phosphorus however is mostly associated with  calcium as a part of the mineral structure of bones and teeth. Blood  phosphorus levels are not controlled as strictly as calcium so the  PTH stimulates renal excretion of phosphate so that it does not  accumulate to toxic levels. Dietary Reference Intakes for Phosphorus  In comparison to calcium, most Americans are not at risk for having  a phosphate deficiency. Phosphate is present in many foods popular  in the American diet including meat, fish, dairy products, processed  foods, and beverages. Phosphate is added to many foods because it  acts as an emulsifying agent, prevents clumping, improves texture  and taste, and extends shelf-life. The average intake of phosphorus  in US adults ranges between 1,000 and 1,500 milligrams per day,  well above the RDA of 700 milligrams per day. The UL set for  phosphorous is 4,000 milligrams per day for adults and 3,000  milligrams per day for people over age seventy.

Magnesium is not an integral part of the hard mineral  crystals, but it does reside on the surface of the crystal and helps  maximize bone structure. Observational studies link magnesium  deficiency with an increased risk for osteoporosis. A magnesium- deficient diet is associated with decreased levels of parathyroid  hormone and the activation of vitamin D, which may lead to an  impairment of bone remodeling. A study in nine hundred elderly  women and men did show that higher dietary intakes of magnesium  correlated to an increased BMD in the hip.1 Only a few clinical  trials have evaluated the effects of magnesium supplements on bone  health and their results suggest some modest benefits on BMD. In addition to participating in bone maintenance, magnesium has  several other functions in the body. In every reaction involving the  1. Tucker KL, Hannan MT, et al.(1994).

These  include copper, zinc, selenium, iodine, chromium, fluoride,  manganese, molybdenum, and others. Although trace minerals are  needed in smaller amounts it is important to remember that a  deficiency in a trace mineral can be just as detrimental to your  health as a major mineral deficiency. Iodine deficiency is a major  concern in countries around the world such as Fiji. In the 1990’s,  almost 50% of the population had signs of iodine deficiency also  known as goiter. To combat this national issue, the government  of Fiji banned non-iodized salt and allowed only fortified iodized  salt into the country in hopes of increasing the consumption of  iodine in people’s diets. With this law, and health promotion efforts  encouraging the consumption of seafood, great progress has been  made in decreasing the prevalence of iodine deficiency in Fiji.1  Figure 11.1 The Trace Minerals  1.

It  is composed of four globular peptides, each containing a heme  complex. In the center of each heme, lies iron (Figure 11.2). Iron is  needed for the production of other iron-containing proteins such as  myoglobin. Myoglobin is a protein found in the muscle tissues that  enhances the amount of available oxygen for muscle contraction. Iron is also a key component of hundreds of metabolic enzymes. Many of the proteins of the electron-transport chain contain  iron–sulfur clusters involved in the transfer of high-energy  electrons and ultimately ATP synthesis. Iron is also involved in  numerous metabolic reactions that take place mainly in the liver  and detoxify harmful substances. Moreover, iron is required for  DNA synthesis. The great majority of iron used in the body is that  recycled from the continuous breakdown of red blood cells.',\n",

The iron in hemoglobin binds to oxygen in the capillaries of the  lungs and transports it to cells where the oxygen is released. If iron  level is low hemoglobin is not synthesized in sufficient amounts  and the oxygen-carrying capacity of red blood cells is reduced,  resulting in anemia. When iron levels are low in the diet the small  intestine more efficiently absorbs iron in an attempt to compensate  for the low dietary intake, but this process cannot make up for  the excessive loss of iron that occurs with chronic blood loss or  low intake. When blood cells are decommissioned for use, the body  recycles the iron back to the bone marrow where red blood cells  are made. The body stores some iron in the bone marrow, liver,  spleen, and skeletal muscle. A relatively small amount of iron is  excreted when cells lining the small intestine and skin cells die and  in blood loss, such as during menstrual bleeding. The lost iron must  be replaced from dietary sources. The bioavailability of iron is highly dependent on dietary sources.',\n",

Anemia is most often treated with iron supplements and increasing  the consumption of foods that are higher in iron. Iron supplements  have some adverse side effects including nausea, constipation,  diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Reducing the dose at first  and then gradually increasing to the full dose often minimizes the  side effects of iron supplements. Avoiding foods and beverages high  in phytates and also tea (which contains tannic acid and  polyphenols, both of which impair iron absorption), is important for  people who have iron-deficiency anemia. Eating a dietary source  of vitamin C at the same time as iron-containing foods improves  absorption of nonheme iron in the gut. Additionally, unknown  compounds that likely reside in muscle tissue of meat, poultry, and  fish increase iron absorption from both heme and nonheme  sources.

Preventing Iron-Deficiency Anemia  In young children iron-deficiency anemia can cause significant  motor, mental, and behavioral abnormalities that are long-lasting. In  the United States, the high incidence of iron-deficiency anemia in  infants and children was a major public-health problem prior to the  early 1970s, but now the incidence has been greatly reduced. This  achievement was accomplished by implementing the screening of  infants for iron-deficiency anemia in the health sector as a common  practice, advocating the fortification of infant formulas and cereals  with iron, and distributing them in supplemental food programs,  such as that within Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). Breastfeeding, iron supplementation, and delaying the introduction  of cow’s milk for at least the first twelve months of life were also  encouraged. These practices were implemented across the  socioeconomic spectrum and by the 1980s iron-deficiency anemia  in infants had significantly declined. Other solutions had to be  introduced in young children, who no longer were fed breast milk  or fortified formulas and were consuming cow’s milk. The following  solutions were introduced to parents: provide a diet rich in sources  of iron and vitamin C, limit cow’s milk consumption to less than  twenty-four ounces per day, and a multivitamin containing iron.

Zinc  also is a cofactor for enzymes involved in energy metabolism. As the  result of its prominent roles in anabolic and energy metabolism, a  zinc deficiency in infants and children blunts growth. The reliance  of growth on adequate dietary zinc was discovered in the early  1960s in the Middle East where adolescent nutritional dwarfism was  linked to diets containing high amounts of phytate. Cereal grains  and some vegetables contain chemicals, one being phytate, which  blocks the absorption of zinc and other minerals in the gut. It is  estimated that half of the world’s population has a zinc-deficient  diet.1  This is largely a consequence of the lack of red meat and seafood  in the diet and reliance on cereal grains as the main dietary staple. In adults, severe zinc deficiency can cause hair loss, diarrhea, skin  sores, loss of appetite, and weight loss. Zinc is a required cofactor  for an enzyme that synthesizes the heme portion of hemoglobin and  severely deficient zinc diets can result in anemia. 1. Prasad, Ananda. (',\n",

The other important function of  selenium is as an antioxidant. Selenium Functions and Health Benefits  Around twenty-five known proteins require selenium to function. Some are enzymes involved in detoxifying free radicals and include  glutathione peroxidases and thioredoxin reductase. As an integral  functioning part of these enzymes, selenium aids in the  regeneration of glutathione and oxidized vitamin C. Selenium as  part of glutathione peroxidase also protects lipids from free  radicals, and, in doing so, spares vitamin E. This is just one example  of how antioxidants work together to protect the body against free- radical induced damage. Other functions of selenium-containing  proteins include protecting endothelial cells that line tissues,  converting the inactive thyroid hormone to the active form in cells,  and mediating inflammatory and immune system responses. Observational  studies  have  demonstrated  that  selenium  deficiency is linked to an increased risk of cancer. A review of forty- nine observational studies published in the May 2011 issue of the  Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews concluded that higher  selenium exposure reduces overall cancer incidence by about 34  percent in men and 10 percent in women, but notes these studies  had several limitations, including data quality, bias, and large  Selenium  |  675',\n",

Iodine  is essential for the synthesis of thyroid hormone, which regulates  basal metabolism, growth, and development. Low iodine levels and  consequently hypothyroidism has many signs and symptoms  including fatigue, sensitivity to cold, constipation, weight gain,  depression, and dry, itchy skin and paleness. The development of  goiter may often be the most visible sign of chronic iodine  deficiency, but the consequences of low levels of thyroid hormone  can be severe during infancy, childhood, and adolescence as it  affects all stages of growth and development. Thyroid hormone  plays a major role in brain development and growth and fetuses  and infants with severe iodine deficiency develop a condition known  as cretinism, in which physical and neurological impairment can  be severe.

Currently,  the results of scientific studies evaluating the usefulness of  chromium supplementation in preventing and treating Type 2  diabetes are largely inconclusive. More research is needed to better  determine if chromium is helpful in treating certain chronic  diseases and, if so, at what doses. If a deficiency of chromium occurs  in the body, signs and symptoms include weight loss, peripheral  neuropathy, elevated plasma glucose concentrations or impaired  glucose use, and high plasma free fatty acid concentrations. Although toxicity of the mineral is a low risk in humans, it can cause  DNA damage, organ damage, and renal problems.

It assists in tooth and bone development and maintenance. Fluoride  combats tooth decay via three mechanisms:  1. Blocking acid formation by bacteria  2. Preventing demineralization of teeth  3. Enhancing remineralization of destroyed enamel  Fluoride was first added to drinking water in 1945 in Grand Rapids,  Michigan; now over 60 percent of the US population consumes  fluoridated drinking water. The Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention (CDC) has reported that fluoridation of water prevents,  on average, 27 percent of cavities in children and between 20 and 40  percent of cavities in adults.

Exposure to  fluoride at three to five times this concentration before the growth  of permanent teeth can cause fluorosis, which is the mottling and  discoloring of the teeth. Figure 11.7 A Severe Case of Fluorosis  Fluoride’s benefits to mineralized tissues of the teeth are well  substantiated, but the effects of fluoride on bone are not as well  known. Fluoride is currently being researched as a potential  treatment for osteoporosis. The data are inconsistent on whether  consuming fluoridated water reduces the incidence of osteoporosis  and fracture risk. Fluoride does stimulate osteoblast bone building  activity, and fluoride therapy in patients with osteoporosis has been  shown to increase BMD. In general, it appears that at low doses,  fluoride treatment increases BMD in people with osteoporosis and  is more effective in increasing bone quality when the intakes of  calcium and vitamin D are adequate. The Food and Drug  Administration has not approved fluoride for the treatment of  osteoporosis mainly because its benefits are not sufficiently known  and it has several side effects including frequent stomach upset and  joint pain. The doses of fluoride used to treat osteoporosis are much  greater than that in fluoridated water. 696  |  Fluoride',\n",
